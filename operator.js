/* today we ar going to discuss about operators. */
// These are the arithmetic operators:
//  +, // Addition
//  -, // Subtraction
//  *, // Multiplication
//  /, // Division
//  %, // Modulus
//  ++, // Post and Pre Increment
//-- // Post and Pre Decrement

/* lets dicuss them one by one.  */

console.log(5 - 2); /* subraction of two numbers. */
console.log(5 * 2); /* multiplication of two numbers */
console.log(10 % 2); /* which is modulos and gives remainder as the about */
console.log(
  10 / 2
); /* which is division here it will give quotient as the output */
/* now lets discuss about post increment and pre increment */
var a = 10; /* intially declare a variable as follows */
console.log(

  b++ /* here the output will be 20 only. */
); /* here it is post increment means use the number first and later increment by 1 */

var b = 30;

/* now we hav Assignment operators as well lets look into them as well accordingly */

//  +=
// var sum += value
// This is a shorthand for var sum = sum + value

// -=,/* var sum-=value and it is also equivalent to sum=sum-value*/

// /=,/* var sum/=value and it is also equivalent to sum=sum/value*/
// %=/* var sum%=value and it is also equivalent to sum=sum%value*/

// these are all the assignment operators.

/* lets moving forward we have Comparision operators. lets look into them as well */

// Comparison Operators: ==, ===, !=, !==, <, <= , >, >=
// Logical Operators: &&, ||, !
// Ternary Operator: â€œ(condition)? //expression for true : //expression for false

// syntax for ternary operator
// (Condition)?'true part':'false part';

//  <: it is less than operator.
//  >: it is greater than operator.
//  <= it is less than or equal to.
//  >= it is greater than or equal to.

/* then we have something called as logical operators as well. */

//  && : it is for logical and operation as we know and operator will return true if both the conditions are true.

/* lets moving forward we are going to learn about coercion. 
coercion meand converting of one data type into another data type. 
it can be done in two ways.
1.implicit coercion : here coercion will be automatically done 
2.explicit coercion: here it is done by programatically  by us.*/

4.speed.
